I had lots of JSON to send and there are tons of 
XML parsers which can parse using parts of the data
and do stuff without knowing the entire file, etc.


Whatever. I thought it would be easy (and i'm writing
this readme before I start this project for no reason
in particular, but i probably won't set up a github
repo until i'm done, or this file will rot on my hard
drive for eternity while i'm working on a JS GIF encoder
based on someone else's AS3 implementation)


Based on www.json.org/json_parse.js
