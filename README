I had lots of JSON to send and there are tons of 
XML parsers which can parse using parts of the data
and do stuff without knowing the entire file, etc.


Whatever. I thought it would be easy (and i'm writing
this readme before I start this project for no reason
in particular, but i probably won't set up a github
repo until i'm done, or this file will rot on my hard
drive for eternity while i'm working on a JS GIF encoder
based on someone else's AS3 implementation)

    This file creates a json_parse function.

        json_parse(text, reviver)
            This method parses a JSON text to produce an object or array.
            It can throw a SyntaxError exception.

            The optional reviver parameter is a function that can filter and
            transform the results. It receives each of the keys and values,
            and its return value is used instead of the original value.
            If it returns what it received, then the structure is not modified.
            If it returns undefined then the member is deleted.

            Example:

            // Parse the text. Values that look like ISO date strings will
            // be converted to Date objects.

            myData = json_parse(text, function (key, value) {
                var a;
                if (typeof value === 'string') {
                    a =
/^(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})T(\d{2}):(\d{2}):(\d{2}(?:\.\d*)?)Z$/.exec(value);
                    if (a) {
                        return new Date(Date.UTC(+a[1], +a[2] - 1, +a[3], +a[4],
                            +a[5], +a[6]));
                    }
                }
                return value;
            });
